# /generate-docs [path]

Generate documentation. Public APIs MUST be documented.

> **No arguments?** Describe this skill and stop. Do not execute.

## First: Activate Workflow

```bash
mkdir -p .claude && echo '{"skill":"doc-code","started":"'$(date -Iseconds)'"}' > .claude/active-workflow.json
```

## Craft Standards (MANDATORY)

**Write documentation a master craftsperson would be proud of.**

Documentation must look like it was written by a skilled human technical writer, not generated by AI.

### AI Antipatterns in Documentation to REJECT

- Restating the obvious (`@param name - the name`)
- Verbose descriptions that add no information
- Generic placeholder text ("This function handles...")
- Documenting every private/internal detail
- Comments that describe WHAT instead of WHY
- Changelog-style comments in code

### Human Craft in Documentation

- Document the WHY, not the obvious WHAT
- Clear examples that show real usage
- Concise descriptions that respect the reader's time
- JSDoc that adds value beyond the type signature
- README sections that help users get started fast

**Test:** Would someone learn something from this doc they couldn't infer from the code? If not, cut it.

## ⚠️ STRICT REQUIREMENTS - NO JUDGMENT CALLS

You MUST do these documentation tasks. Not "consider" - DO:

1. **PUBLIC FUNCTIONS** - Add JSDoc/TSDoc to EVERY exported function
2. **COMPLEX LOGIC** - Add inline comments for non-obvious code
3. **README** - Update if feature adds new usage/commands
4. **TYPES** - Document non-obvious type fields

## FORBIDDEN (Phase will FAIL if detected):

- Over-documenting obvious code
- Adding comments that just repeat the code
- Saying "documentation would help" without writing it
- Skipping JSDoc on public APIs
- Writing vague descriptions ("handles the thing")

## Process

1. **Analyze** - Identify what needs documentation
2. **Document** - Add JSDoc to public APIs, inline comments where needed
3. **Update README** - If feature affects usage
4. **Report** - List what was documented

## REQUIRED Output Format

```markdown
## Documentation: [target]

DOCUMENTED:
- src/service.ts: 5 functions with JSDoc
- src/types.ts: 3 types with field comments
- README.md: Added "Usage" section for new feature

PUBLIC_APIS_DOCUMENTED: N
README_UPDATED: yes/no
COMMENTS_ADDED: N

APPLIED:
- [expert]: [decision]

DOC_COMPLETE
```

## Validation (Phase will FAIL if violated)

- No DOCUMENTED section
- PUBLIC_APIS_DOCUMENTED: 0 when public functions exist

## 🛑 MANDATORY STOP

After documenting:
- DO NOT proceed to any other workflow step
- DO NOT make additional code changes

**Your turn ends here.** Output DOC_COMPLETE and STOP.
