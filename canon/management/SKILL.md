# Grove: High Output Management

Andy Grove's core belief: **A manager's output is the output of their team.** Your job isn't to do the work—it's to multiply the effectiveness of everyone around you.

## The Foundational Principle

> "A manager's output = output of their organization + output of neighboring organizations under their influence."

You're not measured by your personal productivity. You're measured by what you enable others to produce.

## High Output Management

### Managerial Leverage

The key concept: some activities have high leverage, some have low leverage.

**High leverage activities:**
- Setting clear objectives (affects everyone's direction)
- Making timely decisions (unblocks many people)
- Training (multiplies capability permanently)
- One-on-ones (affects morale and effectiveness)

**Low leverage activities:**
- Doing work others could do
- Attending unnecessary meetings
- Micromanaging details

**The formula:**
```
Managerial Output = L1 × A1 + L2 × A2 + L3 × A3...

Where L = leverage of activity, A = time spent
```

Maximize time on high-leverage activities.

### One-on-Ones

> "Ninety minutes of your time can enhance the quality of your subordinate's work for two weeks."

**How to do them:**
1. **Regular cadence** - weekly or biweekly, never skip
2. **Subordinate's meeting** - they set the agenda
3. **Listen more than talk** - your job is to understand
4. **Discuss the important** - not status updates, but obstacles, growth, concerns

**What to cover:**
- What obstacles are blocking you?
- What do you need from me?
- What's on your mind that we haven't discussed?

### Staff Meetings

Different purpose than one-on-ones:

**Purpose:** Peer-to-peer problem solving, information sharing, decision making.

**Your role:** Facilitate, don't dominate. The value is in the team interaction.

**Red flag:** If staff meetings are just status reports to you, they're low leverage.

### Decision Making

Grove's decision-making framework:

1. **Free discussion** - all views expressed
2. **Clear decision** - someone decides (not necessarily consensus)
3. **Full support** - everyone commits, even dissenters

> "Agree and commit, or disagree and commit. Don't disagree and sabotage."

## OKRs: Objectives and Key Results

Grove invented OKRs at Intel. Later adopted by Google and the industry.

### Objectives

**What** you want to achieve. Qualitative, inspirational, memorable.

**Good:** "Dominate the mobile processor market"
**Bad:** "Increase unit sales by 15%"

### Key Results

**How** you'll know you achieved it. Quantitative, measurable, time-bound.

**Good:**
- "Ship 10M units by Q4"
- "Achieve 40% market share"
- "Reduce power consumption to under 5W"

**Bad:** "Improve market position"

### The System

1. **Set OKRs at every level** - company, department, team, individual
2. **Align vertically** - lower OKRs should support higher ones
3. **Stretch goals** - 70% achievement is success (if you hit 100%, you aimed too low)
4. **Grade honestly** - no gaming, no credit for effort
5. **Public and transparent** - everyone sees everyone's OKRs

### Common Mistakes

- **Too many objectives** - focus on 3-5
- **All top-down** - should be mix of top-down and bottom-up
- **Tied to compensation** - kills honest grading
- **Not revisited** - review monthly or quarterly

## Strategic Inflection Points

From "Only the Paranoid Survive":

### The 10X Force

A strategic inflection point occurs when a "10X force" changes the fundamentals of your business.

**10X forces:**
- Technology shift (internet, mobile, AI)
- Competitor innovation (new business model)
- Regulatory change (new laws, deregulation)
- Customer behavior shift (preferences change)

### Signal vs. Noise

> "How do you know when such a point is upon you? The answer is: you don't."

Early signs are ambiguous. The key is to listen to:
- **Cassandras** - people in the organization who see it coming
- **Customers** - especially the ones leaving
- **Frontline employees** - they see changes first

### The Valley of Death

Navigating an inflection point:

```
Performance
    |      Old Strategy
    |    /
    |   /
    |  /     Valley of Death
    | /      ___________
    |/______/           \________
    |                             \
    |                              \ New Strategy
    +---------------------------------> Time
```

You must abandon the old strategy before the new one is proven. This is terrifying. Do it anyway.

### Only the Paranoid Survive

> "Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction. Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive."

When you're winning, you're most vulnerable. The time to change is before you have to.

## Production Principles

Grove applied manufacturing thinking to knowledge work:

### Limiting Step

Every process has a bottleneck. Find it and optimize it.

**In knowledge work:**
- What's the limiting step in your hiring process?
- What's the bottleneck in your development cycle?
- Where does work pile up waiting?

### Inspection

Quality comes from inspection at the lowest-value stage.

> "Detect problems at the earliest, lowest-value stage of the process."

**Applied:**
- Review designs before building
- Catch bugs in code review, not production
- Test assumptions before full commitment

### Batch vs. Individual

Batching creates efficiency but delays output.

**The trade-off:**
- Small batches: faster feedback, more overhead
- Large batches: slower feedback, less overhead

Choose based on how costly delay is.

## The Grove Test

Before acting, ask:

1. **Is this high leverage?** Or could someone else do it?
2. **Am I multiplying effectiveness?** Or just being busy?
3. **Are one-on-ones happening?** And focused on what matters?
4. **Are OKRs clear and measurable?** At every level?
5. **Am I watching for 10X forces?** Who are my Cassandras?
6. **Where's the limiting step?** Am I optimizing the bottleneck?
7. **Am I paranoid enough?** Or am I complacent from success?

## When Reviewing Management

Apply these checks:

- [ ] Focus on high-leverage activities
- [ ] One-on-ones happening with subordinate-driven agenda
- [ ] Decisions made with "disagree and commit" culture
- [ ] OKRs are clear, measurable, and cascaded
- [ ] OKRs are stretch goals (70% = success)
- [ ] Watching for inflection points (paranoid, not complacent)
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified and optimized
- [ ] Quality inspected at lowest-value stage

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Use a different skill when:
- **Navigating crisis or layoffs** → Use `leadership` (wartime leadership, hard decisions)
- **Analyzing competitive moats** → Use `moats` (7 Powers framework)
- **Analyzing industry structure** → Use `competition` (Five Forces, positioning)
- **Evaluating strategy quality** → Use `strategy` (diagnosis-policy-action)

Grove is the **operational management skill**—use it for team effectiveness, OKRs, one-on-ones, and managerial leverage.
