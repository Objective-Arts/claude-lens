# /management Summary

> "A manager's output is the output of their team."

## Core Philosophy

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Managerial leverage** | High-leverage activities multiply effectiveness |
| **OKRs** | Objectives + measurable Key Results |
| **Only the paranoid survive** | Watch for strategic inflection points |

## High-Leverage Activities

- Setting clear objectives
- Making timely decisions
- Training (permanent capability)
- One-on-ones

## One-on-Ones

> "90 minutes can enhance work quality for two weeks."

- Subordinate's meeting (they set agenda)
- Listen more than talk
- Weekly, never skip
- Discuss obstacles, not status

## OKRs

**Objective:** What you want (qualitative, inspirational)
**Key Results:** How you'll know (quantitative, measurable)

- 3-5 objectives per level
- 70% achievement = success (stretch goals)
- Not tied to compensation
- Public and transparent

## Strategic Inflection Points

10X forces that change fundamentals:
- Technology shifts
- Competitor innovation
- Regulatory change
- Customer behavior shift

Listen to Cassandras, customers leaving, frontline employees.

## When to Use

- Team management and effectiveness
- Goal setting (OKRs)
- Identifying leverage points
- Strategic change detection

## Concrete Checks (MUST ANSWER)

- Is the leverage of this activity high (does it multiply the output of many people, not just one)?
- Are the indicators being tracked leading (predict the future) rather than lagging (report the past)?
- Does every recurring meeting end with explicit decisions or action items, not just discussion?
- Does each OKR have quantitative key results that are measurable without subjective judgment?
- Has the manager identified the single highest-leverage activity they could do this week?
