# Thompson: Stratechery

Ben Thompson's core belief: **The internet has fundamentally changed the structure of markets by commoditizing distribution and enabling aggregation.** Understanding Aggregation Theory is essential for analyzing any tech company or digital business.

## The Foundational Principle

> "The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts: suppliers, distributors, and consumers. The best way to make outsize profits is to either gain a horizontal monopoly in one of those parts or to integrate two of the three parts vertically."

In the pre-internet era, distribution was the scarce resource. Now, with the internet, distribution is free—which means the new power accrues to those who aggregate demand.

---

## Aggregation Theory

The internet has inverted the traditional value chain:

```
TRADITIONAL (Distribution Scarcity)
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ Suppliers   │───▶│ Distributors│───▶│ Consumers   │
│ (content)   │    │ (power)     │    │             │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
     Many              Few              Many

INTERNET ERA (Aggregation)
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ Suppliers   │───▶│ Aggregators │◀───│ Consumers   │
│ (commodity) │    │ (power)     │    │ (demand)    │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
     Many              Few              Many
                       ▲
                       │
            Aggregators own the
            consumer relationship
```

### The Three Characteristics of Aggregators

1. **Direct relationship with users** - No intermediary between platform and consumer
2. **Zero marginal costs for serving users** - Adding one more user costs nothing
3. **Network effects that increase value** - More users → more suppliers → more users

### The Virtuous Cycle

```
More Users
    │
    ▼
More Attractive to Suppliers ──▶ Better Supply ──▶ More Users
    │                                                   │
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Examples:**
- Google: More users → more data → better search → more users
- Facebook: More users → more content → more engagement → more users
- Amazon: More buyers → more sellers → better selection → more buyers
- Netflix: More subscribers → more budget → better content → more subscribers

## Platform vs. Aggregator

These are NOT the same thing:

| Aspect | Platform | Aggregator |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Supply | Third-party creates value | Third-party commoditized |
| Control | Shared with developers | Owns entire experience |
| Revenue | Takes cut of transactions | Owns monetization |
| Examples | iOS, Windows, Shopify | Google, Facebook, Netflix |

**Platforms** create ecosystems where third parties build value.
**Aggregators** commoditize supply and own the consumer relationship.

### The Platform Paradox

Platforms need third-party developers to create value, but successful platforms eventually want to capture that value themselves.

> "The most important thing to understand is that platforms are not aggregators: they are the most important counterweight to aggregators."

## Smiling Curve

Value distribution in an industry:

```
           Value
             │
         ┌───┴───┐                    ┌───────┐
         │       │                    │       │
        ─┘       │                    │       └─
                 │                    │
                 │                    │
                 └────────────────────┘

        R&D/     Manufacturing/      Marketing/
        Design   Assembly           Distribution

        High         Low               High
        Value       Value              Value
```

The internet has made the "smile" even more pronounced—manufacturing is commoditized, but design and customer relationships are more valuable than ever.

## Disruption vs. Aggregation

Clayton Christensen's disruption theory vs. Thompson's Aggregation:

**Disruption** (Christensen):
- Entrant starts at low end
- Improves until "good enough"
- Moves up-market
- Incumbent disrupted

**Aggregation** (Thompson):
- Entrant owns consumer relationship
- Commoditizes supply
- Improves user experience
- Incumbent irrelevant

> "Aggregation is not disruption. Aggregators don't start at the low end—they start with a user experience that is immediately better."

---

## The Bill Gates Line

```
                  "Good Enough"
                       │
┌──────────────────────┼────────────────────────┐
│                      │                        │
│  PRODUCT COMPETITION │  ECOSYSTEM COMPETITION │
│                      │                        │
│  • Features matter   │  • Lock-in matters     │
│  • Marketing works   │  • Switching costs     │
│  • Innovation wins   │  • Network effects     │
│                      │                        │
└──────────────────────┼────────────────────────┘
                       │
```

When product quality crosses the "good enough" threshold, competition shifts from features to ecosystems.

## The Stratechery Tests

When analyzing a tech company, ask:

1. **Aggregator or Platform?** Does it own supply or enable third parties?
2. **Where is value?** R&D, operations, or customer relationship?
3. **What is commoditized?** What used to be scarce that is now free?
4. **Who owns the consumer?** Direct relationship or through intermediary?
5. **Are there network effects?** Does more usage make it more valuable?
6. **What's the marginal cost?** Zero (aggregator) or significant (traditional)?
7. **Where on the smiling curve?** High-value ends or commoditized middle?

---

## Analyzing Business Models

### The Four Types of Internet Companies

| Type | Own Supply? | Own Demand? | Example |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Aggregator** | No (commodity) | Yes | Google, Facebook |
| **Platform** | No (ecosystem) | Shared | iOS, AWS |
| **Vertically Integrated** | Yes | Yes | Netflix, Apple |
| **Two-Sided Marketplace** | No | Facilitate | Airbnb, Uber |

### Red Flags

Watch for companies that:
- Claim to be aggregators but don't own consumer relationship
- Claim network effects that aren't defensible
- Compete on features when market is "good enough"
- Don't have zero marginal costs but claim scalability

---

## Strategic Implications

### For Startups

1. **Own the consumer relationship** - Don't let platforms intermediate
2. **Find commoditizable supply** - What can you aggregate?
3. **Zero marginal costs** - Build for scale from day one
4. **Create virtuous cycles** - More users should mean better product

### For Incumbents

1. **Don't fight aggregators on their terms** - You'll lose
2. **Own a platform** - Create an ecosystem others depend on
3. **Vertical integration** - Control the full stack
4. **Focus on what can't be commoditized** - Unique supply

### For Investors

1. **Is this a real aggregator?** - Apply the three tests
2. **What's the moat?** - Network effects, switching costs, or neither?
3. **Commoditization risk?** - Could their supply become commodity?
4. **Platform dependency?** - Who actually owns the consumer?

---

## Common Mistakes

**"We're a platform"** - Most "platforms" are actually just aggregators or marketplaces. True platforms enable third-party value creation.

**"We have network effects"** - Many claim network effects that aren't defensible. Real network effects get stronger with scale.

**"We'll disrupt X"** - Disruption theory is overused. Most successful tech companies are aggregators, not disruptors.

**"The internet is just another channel"** - The internet isn't a channel—it's an entirely new value chain structure.

## When to Use This Skill

Use Thompson/Stratechery when:
- Analyzing tech company strategy
- Evaluating aggregation potential
- Understanding platform dynamics
- Assessing competitive moats in digital markets

Use a different skill when:
- **Competitive positioning** → Use `competition` (Five Forces, generic strategies)
- **Strategy coherence** → Use `strategy` (diagnosis-policy-action)
- **Power/moat analysis** → Use `moats` (7 Powers)
- **Growth strategy** → Use `management` (OKRs, leverage)
