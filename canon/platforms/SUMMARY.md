> "The internet has made distribution free."

## Aggregation Theory

| Characteristic | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Direct consumer relationship** | No intermediary between platform and user |
| **Zero marginal cost** | Adding one more user costs nothing |
| **Network effects** | More users = more suppliers = more users |

## Platform vs Aggregator

| Aspect | Platform | Aggregator |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Supply | Third-party creates value | Third-party commoditized |
| Control | Shared with developers | Owns entire experience |
| Revenue | Takes cut of transactions | Owns monetization |
| Examples | iOS, Windows, Shopify | Google, Facebook, Netflix |

## The Smiling Curve

```
Value high at ends (R&D/Design, Marketing/Distribution)
Value low in middle (Manufacturing/Assembly)
Internet made the smile more pronounced
```

## The Stratechery Tests

1. Aggregator or Platform?
2. Where is value on the smiling curve?
3. What is commoditized?
4. Who owns the consumer relationship?
5. Are there real network effects?
6. What's the marginal cost?

## Common Mistakes

- "We're a platform" → Most are aggregators or marketplaces
- "We have network effects" → Many aren't defensible
- "We'll disrupt X" → Most winners are aggregators, not disruptors

## When to Use

- Analyzing tech company strategy
- Evaluating aggregation potential
- Understanding platform dynamics

## Concrete Checks (MUST ANSWER)

- Has the analysis identified who controls the customer relationship (the company, a platform, or an intermediary)?
- Has it stated what is being aggregated (supply side) and whether that supply is truly commoditized?
- Has margin been located: where in the value chain does profit concentrate, and why?
- Has the company been classified as aggregator, platform, vertically integrated, or marketplace (not conflated)?
- Are claimed network effects real (does more usage make the product measurably more valuable, or is it just growth)?
