# Rumelt: Good Strategy Bad Strategy

Richard Rumelt's core belief: **Most strategy is bad strategy.** Fluff, goals masquerading as strategy, failure to face the challenge. Good strategy is rare, clear, and actionable.

## The Foundational Principle

> "The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors."

Good strategy isn't about ambition. It's about insight into the problem and coherent action to address it.

## The Kernel of Good Strategy

Every good strategy has three elements:

```

### 1. Diagnosis

The diagnosis defines the challenge. It simplifies overwhelming complexity into a comprehensible problem.

**Good diagnosis:**
- Names the critical factors
- Frames the situation in a way that suggests action
- Is based on insight, not just observation

**Example:**
- **Bad:** "We face a competitive market"
- **Good:** "Our high cost structure makes us vulnerable to low-cost competitors in the value segment, while our brand doesn't command premium prices in the luxury segment. We're stuck in the middle."

### 2. Guiding Policy

The guiding policy is an overall approach to overcome the obstacle identified in the diagnosis.

**Good guiding policy:**
- Creates advantage by anticipating actions of others
- Channels action without specifying everything
- Makes trade-offs explicit

**Example:**
- **Bad:** "We will be customer-focused"
- **Good:** "We will focus exclusively on the professional segment, abandoning consumer sales, and compete on service rather than price"

### 3. Coherent Actions

Coherent actions are feasible, coordinated activities that implement the guiding policy.

**Good coherent actions:**
- Are specific and actionable
- Reinforce each other
- Are coordinated, not scattered

**Example:**
- **Bad:** "Improve quality, reduce costs, increase innovation, expand market share"
- **Good:** "Exit the consumer product line by Q2, retrain sales force on enterprise selling, invest the freed-up resources in 24/7 support infrastructure, launch enterprise-only features in Q3"

## Bad Strategy

Bad strategy isn't just the absence of good strategy. It has its own characteristics:

### Hallmark 1: Fluff

> "Fluff is superficial restatement of the obvious combined with a generous sprinkling of buzzwords."

**Example:**
"Our strategy is to be a customer-centric organization that leverages synergies across our portfolio to deliver innovative solutions that maximize shareholder value."

**Translation:** Nothing. Word salad.

### Hallmark 2: Failure to Face the Challenge

If you can't name the challenge, you can't have a strategy for it.

**Example:**
"Our strategy is to grow revenue by 20% per year."

**What's missing:** Why aren't we growing? What's in the way? What will we do differently?

### Hallmark 3: Mistaking Goals for Strategy

Goals are not strategy. Strategy is how you'll achieve goals.

**Example:**
"Our strategy is to be #1 in our market."

**What's missing:** How? What will you do? What trade-offs?

### Hallmark 4: Bad Strategic Objectives

Objectives should be focused and feasible. Bad objectives are:
- A long list of "priorities" (if everything is priority, nothing is)
- Blue-sky goals disconnected from action
- Impossible given current resources

**Example:**
"Our priorities are: quality, innovation, customer satisfaction, employee engagement, sustainability, market leadership, and operational excellence."

**What's missing:** Which one matters most? What will you sacrifice?

## Sources of Power

Good strategy creates advantage. Rumelt identifies sources of power:

### Leverage

> "Strategic leverage arises from a mixture of anticipation, insight into what is most pivotal or critical in a situation, and making a concentrated application of effort."

Find the pivot point. Apply force there.

### Proximate Objectives

Objectives that are close enough to be feasible and far enough to matter.

**Too proximate:** "Answer customer calls within 3 rings"
**Too distant:** "Become the global leader"
**Just right:** "Within 18 months, be the clear #1 choice in the SMB segment in North America"

### Chain-Link Systems

Systems where every link must be strong. The weakest link limits the whole.

**Implication:** Don't invest in strengthening strong links. Fix the weakest link.

### Focus

Concentrate resources. Don't spread thin.

> "The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness."

---

## The Rumelt Test

When evaluating strategy, ask:

1. **Is there a diagnosis?** Does it name the real challenge? Or is it vague?
2. **Is there a guiding policy?** Does it make trade-offs? Or is it "be excellent"?
3. **Are actions coherent?** Do they reinforce each other? Or is it a to-do list?
4. **Is it fluff?** Buzzwords without meaning?
5. **Is it just goals?** "Be #1" is not strategy.
6. **Does it face the challenge?** Or avoid naming what's hard?
7. **Are objectives proximate?** Achievable yet meaningful?
8. **Is focus present?** Or trying to do everything?

---

## When Reviewing Strategy

Apply these checks:

- [ ] Diagnosis names the actual challenge (not vague)
- [ ] Guiding policy makes trade-offs explicit
- [ ] Actions are specific and coordinated
- [ ] Actions reinforce each other (not scattered)
- [ ] Not fluff (no empty buzzwords)
- [ ] Not goals masquerading as strategy
- [ ] Challenge is faced, not avoided
- [ ] Objectives are proximate (achievable)
- [ ] Resources are focused, not spread thin
- [ ] Weakest links identified (chain-link thinking)

---

## Strategy Development Process

Rumelt's approach to developing strategy:

### 1. Diagnose First

Don't jump to solutions. Understand the problem.

**Questions:**
- What is the challenge?
- Why does it exist?
- What's keeping it from being solved?

### 2. Look for Leverage

Find pivot points where focused effort creates disproportionate results.

**Questions:**
- What's the crux—the hard part that, if solved, unlocks everything?
- Where can concentrated effort have outsized impact?

### 3. Design Coherent Action

Actions must work together. Each action should reinforce others.

**Questions:**
- Do these actions conflict with each other?
- Do they build on each other?
- Is anything missing that would prevent success?

### 4. Test for Bad Strategy

Apply the hallmarks:
- Is this fluff?
- Am I avoiding the challenge?
- Are these just goals?
- Are objectives scattered or focused?

## Common Mistakes

**"We need a strategy"** - You need a *good* strategy. Most strategy is bad.

**"Our strategy is to win"** - That's a goal. How?

**"We'll improve everything"** - That's not strategy. What will you *not* do?

**"Let's brainstorm our strategy"** - Strategy comes from insight, not consensus.

**"Here are our strategic priorities" (lists 12 things)** - If everything is priority, nothing is.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Use a different skill when:
- **Analyzing industry forces** → Use `competition` (Five Forces, positioning)
- **Analyzing competitive moats** → Use `moats` (7 Powers framework)
- **Navigating crisis** → Use `leadership` (wartime leadership)
- **Managing team operations** → Use `management` (OKRs, leverage)

Rumelt is the **strategy quality skill**—use it to distinguish good strategy from bad and ensure diagnosis-policy-action coherence.
