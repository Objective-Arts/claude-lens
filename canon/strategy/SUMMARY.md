> "Most strategy is bad strategy."

## The Kernel of Good Strategy

```
DIAGNOSIS → GUIDING POLICY → COHERENT ACTION
(What's the challenge?) (Our approach) (Specific steps)
```

### 1. Diagnosis
Names the critical challenge. Frames it in a way that suggests action.

### 2. Guiding Policy
Overall approach. Makes trade-offs explicit.

### 3. Coherent Actions
Specific, coordinated activities that reinforce each other.

## Bad Strategy Hallmarks

| Hallmark | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Fluff** | Buzzwords without meaning |
| **Failure to face challenge** | "Our strategy is to grow 20%" |
| **Goals as strategy** | "Be #1 in market" |
| **Bad objectives** | 12 "priorities" |

## Good vs Bad Examples

**Bad:** "Our strategy is customer-centric innovation leveraging synergies."

**Good:** "We're stuck in the middle—not cheap enough for value, not premium enough for luxury. We'll focus exclusively on professionals, abandon consumer sales, compete on service."

## The Rumelt Test

1. Is there a diagnosis? (not vague?)
2. Is there a guiding policy? (makes trade-offs?)
3. Are actions coherent? (reinforce each other?)
4. Is it fluff? (buzzwords?)
5. Is it just goals? ("Be #1"?)
6. Does it face the challenge?

## When to Use

- Strategy quality evaluation
- Distinguishing good from bad strategy
- Ensuring diagnosis-policy-action coherence

## Concrete Checks (MUST ANSWER)

- Is there a written diagnosis that names the specific critical challenge in concrete terms (not buzzwords)?
- Is there a guiding policy that states what will and will NOT be done (explicit trade-offs)?
- Are there 3 or more coherent actions listed, and does each action reinforce at least one other action?
- Does the strategy pass the fluff test: could a competitor's strategy be swapped in and still make sense? If yes, it is too generic.
- Is every element a decision or action, not a goal disguised as strategy (e.g., "be #1" or "grow 20%" are goals, not strategy)?
