# /competition Summary

> "The essence of strategy is choosing what NOT to do."

## Five Forces

```
          Threat of New Entrants
                    ↓
Supplier Power → Industry Rivalry ← Buyer Power
                    ↑
          Threat of Substitutes
```

Strong forces = lower industry profitability

## Generic Strategies

|  | Lower Cost | Differentiation |
|--|-----------|-----------------|
| **Broad** | Cost Leadership | Differentiation |
| **Narrow** | Cost Focus | Focused Differentiation |

### Stuck in the Middle

> "Almost guaranteed low profitability."

Warning signs:
- "We're premium AND affordable"
- "We serve everyone"
- No clear trade-offs

## Strategy vs Operational Effectiveness

**NOT strategy:**
- Best practices
- Benchmarking
- Quality management
(Competitors will match these)

**Strategy:**
- Choosing different activities
- Making trade-offs others won't
- Performing activities differently

## The Porter Test

1. Which generic strategy? Is it clear?
2. What trade-offs are we making?
3. Are we stuck in the middle?
4. Which forces are strongest?
5. Is this strategy or just doing same things better?

## Common Mistakes

- "We'll be better at everything" → Wishful thinking
- "Our strategy is growth" → Growth is outcome
- "We'll serve all segments" → No trade-offs made

## When to Use

- Industry structure analysis
- Competitive positioning
- Value chain decisions

## Concrete Checks (MUST ANSWER)

- Have all 5 forces been explicitly analyzed (rivalry, new entrants, substitutes, supplier power, buyer power) with a strength rating for each?
- Have substitute products/services been identified by name, not just acknowledged generically?
- Has the analysis named a single generic strategy (cost leadership, differentiation, cost focus, or focused differentiation) with no "and" hedging?
- Have explicit trade-offs been stated -- what is the company choosing NOT to do?
- Does the analysis distinguish strategy (choosing different activities) from operational effectiveness (doing the same things better)?
