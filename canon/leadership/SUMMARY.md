# /leadership Summary

> "There are no silver bullets, only lead bullets."

## Wartime vs Peacetime

| Peacetime | Wartime |
|-----------|---------|
| Market growing, winning | Existential threat |
| Encourage creativity | Demand discipline |
| Grow the team | Cut ruthlessly |
| Expand culture | Focus on one thing |

**Know which mode. Commit fully.**

## The Hard Things

### Firing
- Be clear it's a firing
- Take responsibility ("I made a hiring mistake")
- Be generous, quick, humane

### Layoffs
- Cut deep enough (once, not waves)
- Over-communicate the why
- Take public responsibility

### Demoting a Friend
- What would I do if they weren't my friend?
- Do that. With respect.

## Culture Rules

- Culture is what you DO, not what you say
- Who gets promoted defines culture
- What gets tolerated defines culture
- Shocking rules stick (generic rules fade)

## The Struggle

> "The Struggle is when you wonder why you started."

- Don't carry it alone
- There's always a move (chess, not checkers)
- Play long enough to get lucky
- Don't take it personally

## When to Use

- Crisis leadership
- Hard personnel decisions
- Wartime conditions
- Building authentic culture

## Concrete Checks (MUST ANSWER)

- Has decision-making authority been assigned to a single named person for this crisis/situation?
- Is there a defined communication chain: who tells whom, in what order, within what timeframe?
- Has the wartime/peacetime mode been explicitly declared, and do current actions match that mode?
- Does a fallback plan exist if the primary course of action fails?
- For personnel decisions: has the question "what would I do if this person were not my friend?" been answered honestly?
