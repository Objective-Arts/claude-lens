# Helmer: 7 Powers

Hamilton Helmer's core belief: **Strategy is about creating durable differential returns.** Not just winning—winning in a way that lasts. That requires Power.

## The Foundational Principle

> "Power is the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent significant differential returns."

If you don't have Power, competition will erode your advantage. Margins compress. You become a commodity. Power is the moat.

---

## The 7 Powers Framework

Each Power has:
- **Benefit** - how it creates superior returns
- **Barrier** - why competitors can't copy it

```
POWER               BENEFIT                 BARRIER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scale Economies     Lower costs             Prohibitive cost to match scale
Network Effects     More users = more value Winner-take-all dynamics
Counter-Positioning Better model            Cannibalization dilemma
Switching Costs     Retain customers        Risk and cost to switch
Branding            Price premium           Long time and consistency
Cornered Resource   Exclusive access        Can't be replicated
Process Power       Superior execution      Complexity and opacity
```

---

## Power 1: Scale Economies

**Definition:** Per-unit costs decline as volume increases.

**The Benefit:** You're more profitable at the same price, or can undercut on price.

**The Barrier:** Competitors must match your volume to match your costs. That's expensive or impossible.

**Examples:**
- Intel in microprocessors (fab costs spread over millions of chips)
- Netflix in content (production cost spread over millions of subscribers)
- Amazon in logistics (warehouse network gets more efficient with volume)

**Test:** Do your per-unit costs meaningfully decline with scale? Is matching that scale prohibitively expensive?

---

## Power 2: Network Effects

**Definition:** Value to each user increases as more users join.

**The Benefit:** You become more valuable just by being bigger.

**The Barrier:** Winner-take-all dynamics. Second place may not be viable.

**Types:**
- **Direct:** More users = more value (Facebook, phones)
- **Indirect:** More of one side = more value for other side (Uber drivers/riders)
- **Data:** More users = better product from data (Google search)

**Examples:**
- Facebook (more friends = more value)
- Visa (more merchants = more cardholders = more merchants)
- Waze (more drivers = better traffic data)

**Test:** Does each additional user make the product more valuable for existing users?

---

## Power 3: Counter-Positioning

**Definition:** A newcomer adopts a superior business model that the incumbent can't copy without damaging their existing business.

**The Benefit:** You have a better model.

**The Barrier:** The incumbent would cannibalize themselves to match you. They can't respond.

**Examples:**
- Netflix vs. Blockbuster (streaming cannibalized store revenue)
- Vanguard vs. active funds (low-cost indexing destroyed fee income)
- Tesla vs. dealers (direct sales threatened dealer network)

**Test:** Would copying you damage the incumbent's existing business? Is the damage significant enough to prevent response?

**Warning:** Counter-positioning is temporary. Eventually incumbents adapt or die. You need another Power for the long term.

---

## Power 4: Switching Costs

**Definition:** The cost (money, time, risk) a customer incurs to switch to a competitor.

**The Benefit:** Customer retention even without being the best option.

**The Barrier:** Customers are locked in by the cost of leaving.

**Types:**
- **Financial:** Breaking contracts, migration costs
- **Procedural:** Learning new system, changing habits
- **Relational:** Losing data, history, connections

**Examples:**
- Enterprise software (data migration, retraining)
- Banks (direct deposit, auto-pay, account numbers)
- Apple ecosystem (photos, apps, device integration)

**Test:** What would it cost (money, time, risk) for a customer to switch away? Is it significant?

---

## Power 5: Branding

**Definition:** Durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering.

**The Benefit:** Price premium and/or higher volume at same price.

**The Barrier:** Takes years of consistency to build. Can't be copied quickly.

**Requirements for Brand Power:**
1. **Affective valence** - evokes positive emotion
2. **Uncertainty reduction** - trusted to deliver quality
3. **Built over time** - not manufacturable quickly

**Examples:**
- Tiffany (same diamond, higher price)
- Hermès (same leather, 10x price)
- Apple (premium for perceived quality and status)

**Test:** Can you charge more for an objectively similar product? Would customers choose you over an identical cheaper alternative?

**Warning:** Brand is not reputation. Reputation is expected quality. Brand is *irrational* preference.

---

## Power 6: Cornered Resource

**Definition:** Preferential access to a valuable resource that competitors cannot acquire.

**The Benefit:** You have something they can't get.

**The Barrier:** The resource is genuinely unavailable to others.

**Types:**
- Patents and IP
- Exclusive contracts
- Unique talent
- Geographic rights
- Regulatory licenses

**Examples:**
- Pixar (unique creative talent in early days)
- Qualcomm (essential patents)
- Sports teams (exclusive player contracts)

**Test:** Do you have access to something valuable that competitors genuinely cannot acquire?

**Warning:** Most "cornered resources" aren't actually cornered. Patents expire. Talent leaves. Contracts end. Verify the barrier.

---

## Power 7: Process Power

**Definition:** Embedded organization and processes that enable superior execution.

**The Benefit:** You're operationally better.

**The Barrier:** Processes are deeply embedded, opaque, and hard to replicate.

**Requirements:**
- Built over time through iteration
- Embedded in organization, not documented
- Complex and interlocking

**Examples:**
- Toyota Production System
- Amazon's logistics and fulfillment
- Danaher Business System

**Test:** Is your operational advantage embedded in processes that took years to develop? Could a competitor with resources replicate it quickly?

**Warning:** Process Power is rare and hard to verify. Most operational advantages are temporary.

---

## When Powers Apply

| Stage | Relevant Powers |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Origination** (startup) | Counter-Positioning, Cornered Resource |
| **Takeoff** (growth) | Network Effects, Scale Economies |
| **Stability** (maturity) | Switching Costs, Branding, Process Power |

Counter-Positioning is usually *first*—it's how you enter. But it fades. You need to build other Powers before it does.

---

## The Helmer Test

When analyzing a business, ask:

1. **Which Powers does this business have?** Be specific.
2. **What's the Benefit?** How does it create superior returns?
3. **What's the Barrier?** Why can't competitors copy it?
4. **Is the Barrier real?** Or wishful thinking?
5. **What stage is the business?** Origination, takeoff, stability?
6. **What Powers should they build next?** Before current Powers fade?

---

## When Evaluating Strategy

Apply these checks:

- [ ] At least one Power identified (or strategy is weak)
- [ ] Both Benefit AND Barrier articulated
- [ ] Barrier is real, not assumed
- [ ] Stage-appropriate Powers being built
- [ ] Not confusing operational effectiveness with Power
- [ ] Not confusing growth with Power
- [ ] Path to durable Power clear (not just Counter-Positioning)

---

## Common Mistakes

**"We're growing fast"** - Growth is not Power. Growth without Power leads to margin compression.

**"We have the best product"** - Best product is not Power. Someone can build a better product.

**"We're more efficient"** - Efficiency is not Power (usually). It can be copied.

**"We have great culture"** - Culture is not Power (usually). It doesn't create Barrier.

**"We have data"** - Data is only Power if it creates Network Effects or is truly Cornered.

---

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Use a different skill when:
- **Analyzing industry forces** → Use `competition` (Five Forces, supplier/buyer power)
- **Evaluating strategy coherence** → Use `strategy` (diagnosis-policy-action)
- **Navigating crisis** → Use `leadership` (wartime leadership)
- **Managing team operations** → Use `management` (OKRs, leverage)

Helmer is the **moat analysis skill**—use it when evaluating whether competitive advantage is durable and which of the 7 Powers applies.
