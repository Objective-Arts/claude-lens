# /moats Summary

> "Power is what makes moats durable."

## The 7 Powers

| Power | Benefit | Barrier |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Scale Economies** | Lower per-unit costs | Costly to match volume |
| **Network Effects** | More users = more value | Winner-take-all |
| **Counter-Positioning** | Better model | Incumbent would cannibalize self |
| **Switching Costs** | Retain customers | Risk/cost to leave |
| **Branding** | Price premium | Years of consistency |
| **Cornered Resource** | Exclusive access | Unavailable to others |
| **Process Power** | Superior execution | Embedded, opaque |

## When Powers Apply

| Stage | Powers |
|-------|--------|
| Origination (startup) | Counter-Positioning, Cornered Resource |
| Takeoff (growth) | Network Effects, Scale Economies |
| Stability (maturity) | Switching Costs, Branding, Process Power |

## The Helmer Test

For each claimed advantage:
1. What's the Benefit? (how it creates returns)
2. What's the Barrier? (why competitors can't copy)
3. Is the Barrier real?

## Common Mistakes

- "We're growing fast" → Growth is not Power
- "We have the best product" → Can be copied
- "We're more efficient" → Usually not durable
- "We have great culture" → Not a barrier

## When to Use

- Evaluating competitive moats
- Strategic durability analysis
- Investment decisions

## Concrete Checks (MUST ANSWER)

- Has the analysis identified which specific Power (of the 7) applies, by name?
- For the claimed Power, has the Benefit been stated (how it creates differential returns)?
- For the claimed Power, has the Barrier been stated (why competitors cannot replicate it)?
- Is the Barrier durable -- would it still hold in 5 years if a well-funded competitor attacked it?
- Has counter-positioning been evaluated: would the incumbent have to cannibalize their existing business to match?
- Has the analysis avoided confusing growth, product quality, or culture with a named Power?
