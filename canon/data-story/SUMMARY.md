# /data-story Summary

> "Every element should earn its place."

## The Six Lessons

### 1. Understand Context
- **WHO** is your audience?
- **WHAT** do you want them to do? (specific action)
- **HOW** will you communicate? (live, written, dashboard)

### 2. Choose Effective Visuals

| Relationship | Best Chart | Avoid |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Comparison | Horizontal bar | Pie, 3D |
| Time series | Line chart | Area |
| Part-to-whole | 100% stacked bar | Pie (>3 slices) |
| Correlation | Scatterplot | Dual-axis |

### 3. Eliminate Clutter

Remove: borders, gridlines, data markers, legends, axis lines, bold formatting

```
For each element: "Would removing this change the meaning?"
NO → Remove it
```

### 4. Focus Attention

- **ONE thing** boldest/brightest (your main point)
- Supporting elements in medium gray
- Everything else in light gray or removed

### 5. Think Like a Designer

- Title states the insight: "Sales grew 15%" not "Sales Data"
- Direct labels instead of legends
- No rotated text

### 6. Tell a Story

- **Beginning**: Current situation, why it matters
- **Middle**: Problem or opportunity, stakes
- **End**: What should audience do?

## Quick Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Too busy" | Remove gridlines, borders; use direct labels |
| "Generic title" | State the insight |
| "Pie with 8 slices" | Horizontal bar, sorted |
| "Can't read labels" | Rotate chart |
| "Dual y-axes" | Split into two charts |

## When to Use

- Data visualization design
- Presentation slides
- Dashboard reviews
- Chart selection

## Concrete Checks (MUST ANSWER)

- Does each visualization communicate exactly one clear insight (stated in the title as a finding, not a label)?
- Are key data points annotated with text explaining why they matter?
- Does the presentation follow a narrative arc: setup (context), tension (problem/opportunity), resolution (what to do)?
- Is there exactly one visual element that is boldest/brightest, representing the main point?
- Has every visual element been tested with "would removing this change the meaning?" -- if no, remove it.
